Use tweet of interest to identify
- user, time
Build dataset on user's tweet timeline
- past and present tweets
Create vector embeddings of the tweet:
- Text
- Entities : Name, Organization, Location
- Relations
- Subject

Use Cosine Similarity to create a cluster of similar tweets (compare text vector)

Compare entity, relation, subject embedding of tweet with the cluster.

if (similarity > 0.8): //tunable value
    consistent;
else :
    inconsistent;

As part of the report we could show:
if consistent / inconsistent
- show the consistency value
- and the threads/tweets to support it
